# Polling Unit Results Project

This is a Django-based web application to manage and display polling unit results for an election. It allows users to add results for polling units, view results by LGA (Local Government Area), and view polling unit-specific results by party. The application uses Django for the backend and basic HTML templates for frontend rendering.

## Features

    - **Add Polling Unit Results**: Input polling unit ID and party scores.
    - **View Polling Unit Results**: View the results of parties in a specific polling unit.
    - **View LGA Results**: Filter and view results based on the selected LGA.
    - **Dynamic Forms**: The ability to add multiple party scores dynamically.

## Installation

    ### Prerequisites

    - Python 3.x
    - Django 3.x or later
    - SQL or any other database of your choice

### Steps to Get Started

    1. **Clone the repository**:

git clone https://github.com/Dannynsikak/Bincom_election.git
cd Bincom_election
Create a virtual environment:

    python3 -m venv .venv
    Activate the virtual environment:

    On Windows:

    venv\Scripts\activate
    On Mac/Linux:


    source venv/bin/activate
    Install the required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    Migrate the database: Django uses migrations to handle database schema changes. Run the following command to set up the database:
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate

    Start the development server:

    python manage.py runserver
    Access the application: Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 to view the application.
